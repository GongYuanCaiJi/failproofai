/**
 * Agent archetype catalog + classifier.
 *
 * Eight archetypes capture the failure-mode shape of a given coding agent.
 * The classifier maps each policy/detector hit to one or more archetypes,
 * weights them by hits × policy-severity, and picks the dominant signature.
 *
 * Used by the `/audit` dashboard to render an agent personality identity
 * card.
 *
 * Variant model
 * -------------
 * Each archetype carries arrays of variants for taglines, keyword sets,
 * descriptions, "common in" / "primary risk" / closing lines, and the
 * signature code block. `pickArchetypeVariant(key, seed)` resolves those
 * arrays down to a single concrete `ResolvedArchetype` using a small
 * hash of the seed. Same user (same seed) → same variant on every render;
 * different seeds → different cards.
